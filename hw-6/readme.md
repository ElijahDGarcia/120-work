# Experience discussion!
It took me a long time to get this assignment done, mostly because I was simply
afraid to start. Math scared me, I'll admit it freely, but those videos really
helped me understand what random functions and modulo stuff meant and how it
can be utilized. That video guy is an amazing... Explainer!
## How'd you do it?
Lots of referencing, video re-watching, and experimenting. I used the video-guy's
example of random dots as a baseline for my idea, and then implemented what I wanted
to do. I was originally gonna do a matrix-style green number rain thing, but That
was way too daunting.
### Issues?
I kept using the = sign in the object instead of :.

I also set my alpha channel to 0 in my object on accident and was really confused
when i couldn't see my stuff.
