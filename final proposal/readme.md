# A proposal for what you want to create for your final project.

I want to create a word 'game'. Not really a game, but a program that
generates different text, words, and colors depending on what letters or colors they click. For example, they might be given the word 'hello'. If they click on L, which is highlighted blue, they'll get another word which starts with L or get a word with entirely blue text.

## Related and similar work that is serving as an inspiration.
Briefly discuss other artists or projects that are similar or influential to your proposed final project.
I've been trying to recreate the matrix text program for awhile, but I'm having a lot of trouble. I decided to give up and work on something more easy, but I still like the idea of text being a medium for art.

### A brief discussion of any problems you know you will have to solve or new technologies/techniques you will need to learn.

I'll have to overcome my fear of extensive array usage, certainly. Maybe learn about randomization of results that are still constrained within the parameters. (Ex. Click on L, get a random letter as long as that letter as L at the start)

### A work plan, with internal deadlines for yourself and a description about how you intent to complete the final project on time.

Work hard every day. Figure out how do lay out the groundwork by at least dec. 5th, if not, work on something easier.

### A discussion of any work you have completed this week towards your final project.

Figuring out how to color individual letters in a string of text.
