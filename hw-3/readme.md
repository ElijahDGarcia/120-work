# Experience discussion!
I had a fun time messing around with functions, and was frankly 'wow'ed when
watching that first video. The fact that I could change colors and interact
with things even as the video played was great. I only saw stuff like this back
in the day after long Flash load times. HTML5 really has changed the face of
the internet.
## How'd you do it?
I followed all instructions given, though I did some tweaking here and there to
make sure I was doing things correctly (such as changing values)
### Issues?
I had a problem at first when trying to test my 'website' on Chrome, and it even
caused my entire browser to crash! It seemed to fix itself with a restart though,
with no changes to code. It was probably a google chrome 'canary' misshap. I'll
post about it in the repo.

### Help?
I tried to explain how the URL of a github static site worked, but I worry that
I may have explained it in a more obtuse way.

current p5 version -> 0.7.1
