# Experience discussion!
I tried to recreate the matrix text thing using loops. It didn't quite work, but
I learned a lot.
## How'd you do it?
Lots of googling, bugfixing, and video watching. Eventually I gave up on my
original task and went in a different direction.
### Issues?
I couldn't get the y axis of my numbers to rain down from the x axis using loops
