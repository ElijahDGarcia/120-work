# Experience discussion!
This week was really fun, I think! Lots of messing around with code, and poring
through documentation. I didn't really want to make a self-portrait, so I came
up with the idea of doing a fox instead. Used to see them all the time up in
the mountains!
## How'd you do it?
Lots of triangles, ellipsis, arcs, and one rectangle. I made my canvas 500x500
so that it would be easy to remember where points were on a graph. I centered
the graph as well, so that things would be symmetrical. I used the Color Picker
addon! Makes things really easy.
### Issues?
Centering the canvas using **transform(250,250)** messed things up. The negative
numbers went up, and the positive numbers went down. Weird!
