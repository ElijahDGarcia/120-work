# Experience discussion!
This is the most stressful project I've done so far in my experience in college.
Sleepless nights, lots of googling, and lots of example sniffing.
I could hardly get anything to work right.
I learned a lot about issues that were tangential to my own, but couldn't figure
out how to solve my own.
In the end, I could only do the best I could with the knowledge I had, rather
than what I had envisioned in my mind. I wanted to work with words, but that
ended up hurting me a lot more than it ended up helping me.
It would've been a lot simpler with ellipses, but at the point I realized that,
it was too late to turn back. Figuring out distance with words is harder than
distance with circles. I originally wanted to have words cascading down the page,
with various emotions and colors at the bottom in the form of buttons that you
could press in order to get rid of words that matched. An anger button to get
rid of words like pain, or suffering. A blue button to get rid of words that were
colored blue. However, I soon realized that having the words and the buttons in
seperate classes made it extremely hard for them to interact with one another. I
still don't really know how to do it, but I managed to eke out a simple 'press
the green button in order to reset the page' thing. Working around arrays is hard.
I assigned each random word with a color property, but I could not get my buttons
to interact with them based on color property. I could either erase all the words,
or (more commonly) none. I opted with none, and instead turned the cursor into an
eraser which only works on the right side of the screen and erases (turns white)
everything. You can still see the text if you move the color ball, though. And the
ball next to the mouse will change color based on which random color the program chooses
for the next word. I had to assign colors to array numbers in an array in order to
get a random selection of three colors. For example, getting a random color is easy;
but getting a random color from a selection of only red, green, or blue, is not easy.
I simply could not figure out how to delete objects from an array based on an individual
property, and the internet wasn't much help. I'm happy with what I got out of it,
and I learned that putting classes and arrays into their own documents is really, really useful.
I might've been able to finish everything had I not had the burden of other class finals
shadowing my every move, but I did my best.
## How'd you do it?
