Lines 3 through 10 are defining the data within the object 'ball'.

The setup function creates a canvas that's the width of the original window, but
only 400 pixels high.

 Lines 21 and 22 define the location of the ball based on delta and scale variables


 Lines 25 through 27 keep ball bouncing off of horizontal surfaces
 Lines 28 through 30 keep ball bouncing off vertical surfaces
