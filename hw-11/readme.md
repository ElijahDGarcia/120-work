# Experience discussion!
It was really, really hard.

But I finally did it.

I asked a friend who works in the industry to look over my code and he gave me tips, and it was amazingly useful.
## How'd you do it?
I used a function called setInterval to add a new object to the array every 250 milliseconds, which finally allowed for each individual object to slide down the screen at a timed pace instead of all at once
### Issues?
It took me 6 hours to figure out how to make the objects in the array all go down at seperate times and different intervals. When  I first started, I put 50 objects in the array, and no matter what I did, they all fell down at once. I learned, though.
