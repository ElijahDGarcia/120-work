# Experience discussion!
It was really hard. I had a hard time keeping variables defined throughout the
entire project, and ended up putting a lot inside each function. I don't really
know how to keep a variable defined throughout all functions when it comes to an
array. Outside of the draw or canvas functions, i could not give a variable the
'color' attribute. I don't know why
## How'd you do it?
Lots of googling. Like, a lot. I even made a stackexchange account.
### Issues?
LOTS! It's hard!! I couldn't figure out why my bigDot function wasn't being
defined, so i ended up just putting it on the top. I thought functions were always defined
first no matter where they were : (
