# Experience discussion!
Lots of googling and looking at code examples for this one. The idea that the
canvas rotates instead of the object itself really threw me off for awhile.
## How'd you do it?
Lots of googling, trial and error, and example looking. Animation is hard!
### Issues?
I didn't really know how to get one ball to orbit another, even with the examples
given. I also wanted to make the static orbiting ball change its color based on its
own x and y coordinates, but didn't know how to do that either.
